Tips: ASIC resistant coins are cryptocurrencies with ASIC-resistant algorithms. However, the 
process of making a cryptocurrency ASIC-resistant is a defensive game, which requires continued 
development and modifications. This is due to the reason that ASIC designers and manufacturers 
are constantly producing new models of ASIC miners, and sometimes, the newer models are able to 
bypass the ASIC-resistance of certain cryptocurrencies.
